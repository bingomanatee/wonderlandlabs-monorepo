note - we always dump Forestry state into useState to ensure
the component re-renders every time the state changes. In this case
we don't use it in the effects but this is a standard of using
Forestry in [React](/concepts/react).

The complexity of the `makeNumbersState()` function is due
to the fact that "double loading" leaves the `Forest` instance
in the reference.
