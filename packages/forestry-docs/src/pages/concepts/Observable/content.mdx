Forestry conforms to the basic `Subscribable` model - trees can be
subscribed to and provide a subject that can be `.pipe`d with any number
of modifiers.

Further the Forest exposes an observable for any named tree that only eimits when all
nested transactions have emptied; so, you can observe trees on a change by change basis,
or you can observe only the validated complete actions after every topmost action has
completed, reducing transitional noise of sub-actions.

## Example: counting your eggs

This is a variation of the eggs example from [concepts: Transactional](/concepts/transactional).

The setup and actions is the same, except now we are subscribing to the activity at both
the tree and Forest level and echoing the result at the end.

<SeeMore title="The eggSample">
<EggSample />
</SeeMore>

This time, we are subscribing to a summary of our eggs, with two subscribers. (RxJS tech note - in production,
save the subscribers so you can cancel them later)

<Observation />

see [React](/concepts/react) for an example of how observation plays
out in React.
