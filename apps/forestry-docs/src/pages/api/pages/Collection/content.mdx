## Collection

A Collection is a class that decorates the Tree class and combines it with custom actions.
Collections create a new tree upon instantiation and access it with decorating methods.
However, there are a few extra nuances to be aware of:

1. All the actions it provides are wrapped in [`forest.do(...)`](/api/forest), providing automatic
   transactional insulation.
2. the Forest argument is optional in the Collection constructor, meaning you can automatically
   create a Collection with its own dedicated Forest instance.
3. Unlike Trees, creating a new collection with `myCollection = new Collection(...)`
   _is the best (only) way_ to create a collection.
4. Collections use the same namespace as trees in the forest; if the $name of the collection
   may conflict and is not important use `forest.uniqueNameLike('myName')` to create a safe
   $name for the collection.

 Collections can be extended to allow custom methods referencing the collections' tree to create
 selectors and/or sub-collections.

## Changing a Collection value

As with [Trees](/api/tree), while changing a collection with `myCollection.next(value)`
is easiest (and for scalar values, the best) way to change state for simple values,
for complex values or dense objects, `myCollection.update(changeFn, seed?)`
is generally a better way to change _part_ of the state;
it takes less memory especially if you reuse the changeFn out of a library.

## Constructor

Constructor takes four arguments:

* `$name`: a string; can be anything of any length (it functions as a "Map" key)
* `params`: defined by TreeParams; at minimum it is `{initial: [value]}`, the value of the state at start.
  See [TreeParams](/api/tree-params) for an exhaustive list of properties.
* `actions`: an object containing functions, the "this" value for which is the collection.
* `forest`: a [`Forest`](/api/forest) instance. optional

```
const f = new Forest();

const counter: CollectionIF<number> = new Collection(
  'counter',
   {initial: 3},
   {increment() {this.next(this.value + 1)},
   forest);

```

Those familiar with RxJS will recognize much of the profile of BehaviorSubject. Trees don't share code
with BehaviorSubjects but they do have most of the same interface.

## Methods

### `next(value: <ValueType>): void`

Sets the current value of the Tree. If the validator fails, will throw.

### `update((currentValue: <ValueType>, seed?: any) => nextValue)`

changes the value of the tree parametrically.

```
const forest = new Forest();
const increment = (n) => n + 1;
const add(n, seed) => n + seed;
const counter = forest.addTree('counter', {initial: 0});
const $broadcast = counter.subscribe((value) => console.log('counter = ', value));
// counter = 0
counter.update(increment);
// counter = 1;
counter.update(increment);
// counter = 2;
counter.update(add, 5);
// counter = 7;
```

### `subscribe(onChange):` [`subscription`](https://rxjs.dev/guide/subscription)

adds a listener to the value of the tree. Will $broadcast immediately when added with the
current state value.

### `observe(onChange):` [`subscription`](https://rxjs.dev/guide/subscription)

returns a subscribable that updates every time all pending actions complete.

<Observable />
</SeeMore>

### `$validate(value: <ValueType>): {$isValid: boolean, error?: string, tree, value}`

returns information about the validity of a value. Does not throw, or change the value of the tree.

## Properties

### `value: <ValueType>`

The current value of the state.


### `act: {[string]: actionFunction}`

resolves the third parameter into a set of functions bound to the collection instance. this means that
`this` in the function will refer to the collection itself allowing for `this.next(...)`,
 `this.update(...)`, etc. Note: in typescript you can also provide the "this" as the first argument as in:

```

const forest = new Forest();

const collection = new Collection<number>(
  'counter',
  { initial: 0},
  {
    increment(this: CollectionIF<number>) { this.next(this.value + 1)},
    decrement() { this.next(this.value - 1)},
    add(this: CollectionIF<number>, sum: number) { this.next(this.value + sum) }
  }
)

const sub = collection.subscribe((value) => console.log('counter is now ', value);
// counter is now 0

collection.act.increment();
// counter is now 1

collection.act.add(10);
// counter is now 11

collection.act.decrement();
// counter is now 10

```

For increment and add, the variable $name `this` is significant; it would not work as expected with
a variable $name like `coll` etc.

#### Transactional insulation

All actions are bound in [`forest.do(...)`](/api/forest)
and provide [transactional insurance](/concepts/transactional).

#### Arguments

Actions can take any number of arguments. That being said, `next` and `update` can take only up to one
argument so you'll need to merge/condense all parameters into the built-in Collection methods before
calling them.
