# Forest 3.0 (forest-ts)

Forest has been a very useful framework (to me) but it was done in the spirit of "make the code as good as it can be
and make it as Typescript compliant as you can." This is not in our current reality "good enough" - so I am
re-engineering it with the idea that the classes and the methods are fully typed, and those types are generated by
the (soon to be CLI) forest Schema generator that takes in a configuration and expels all the necessary classes and
type definitions.

Given the volume of type, these are one in namespaces to prevent global pollution and organize the output.

Initially I may in fact walk back some of the transactional insulation of Forest 2.0; but eventually, F3 will have
all the full containment that F2 has.

## Interface Changes

The Python style of methods in F2 is being replaced by a more classical set of methods attached to the Leaf; this means
that there is no longer going to be a difference between the parameters expressed in the actions and those in their definitions.
And that instead of the first argument being the leaf, the context will be the good ol' `this` standin. (this may at some
point be a configurable option). This should make the states far less obtuse to read through and understand.
