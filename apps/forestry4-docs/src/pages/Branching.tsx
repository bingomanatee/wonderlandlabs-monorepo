          <Text textStyle="body" mb={4}>
            Branches solve the fundamental problem of <strong>state organization</strong>
            in complex applications. Instead of managing everything in one monolithic store,
            branches let you create focused, single-responsibility sub-stores that automatically
            stay synchronized with their parent.

              Think of branches like focused teams in a company - each team has its own
              responsibilities and expertise, but they all work toward the same organizational goals
              and share information when needed.

        <Section title="Branch Lifespan">
          <Text textStyle="body">
            Branches can be as short-lived as you want - you can even create a branch, call a method
            on it, then <code>.complete()</code> it. Unlike calling root-level complete which
            freezes the entire store (and all its branches), completing a branch only terminates the
            utility of <i>that branch</i>
            and all its' branches; the parent and all other sibling branches (and the root) remain
            functional. In fact, if you don't need a branch, its a good idea to complete() it and
            lower the bandwidth for the entire system.
          </Text>
          <Text textStyle="body">
            Similarly you can create a branch as late as you want - you don't need to create all the
            branches at once of you don't need them until later.

        <Section title="How Branches Work">
          <Text textStyle="body" mb={4}>
            Branches are <strong>focused sub-stores</strong> that represent a specific path in your
            state tree. They maintain automatic two-way synchronization with their parent store and
            provide all the same capabilities as root stores.
          </Text>

          <Text textStyle="body">
            In reality only the root "owns" the value - all the branches <i>refer</i> to part of the
            store (a "sub path" of the overall data) with methods specific to changing and analyzing
            that branch. This can be repeated to any depth you want. why this matters, for instance,
            is that all transactions are actually managed by the root store, even if they are
            created in a branch store.

        <Section title="Custom Branch Classes">
          <Text textStyle="body" mb={4}>
            The real power of branches comes from creating custom subclasses with domain-specific
            methods and computed properties. This creates focused, reusable components that
            encapsulate business logic.

        <Section title="Branch Validation">
          <Text textStyle="body" mb={4}>
            Branches can have their own validation schemas and rules, providing focused validation
            at the appropriate level of your state tree. This is especially powerful for form
            validation and data integrity. Be careful though - the more validation you add to branch
            instances, the more limited <i>every</i> store becomes. If you create a store with
            schema and tests, then even changes to data in the root scope will trigger schema and
            branch validation to <i>all the branches</i> - all the way down the hierarchy - which if
            they become too numerous may become a performance consideration, as well as a burden to
            developers to understand why their changes are being blocked.

              <Text>
                One thing you may <i>not</i> want to do is define schema for every branch; if the
                top level schema is inclusive it's redundant and just creates more work for you to
                maintain, and for the state system to process with every update.

            Branches shine in React applications by allowing components to subscribe to only the
            data they need. This improves performance and makes components more focused and
            testable. That is, if you create a memoized component and have it depend on the data
            from a branch, <b>it will re-render less often</b> than if you pass the value of the
            global state into it and select part of that data inside the components' context.
