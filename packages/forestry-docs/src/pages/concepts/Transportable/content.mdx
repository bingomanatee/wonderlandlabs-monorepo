import {SeeMore} from "../../../components/SeeMore";

Because Forestry states are class instances they are transportable: they can be
instantiated for individual components, or kept globally as resources that can
be subscribed to by any component that needs access to their data or methods.

They can be used in React Native, and can also be used in "not React" -- Angular, Vue or general purpose Javascript applications, or web workers.

In fact they are not at all dependent on Browser context 
and can be used in a server.

## Testing Trees

Trees can be tested absent of their view to validate business concepts.
This is 1000% more efficient than mocking up and simulating user interactions
in a headless view scenario. Changes to business values operate in their own
sphere, and shouldn't be dependent on the view that expresses their state
out to the DOM.
