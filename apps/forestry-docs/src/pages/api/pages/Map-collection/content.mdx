## MapCollection

While you don't _have_ to use this class to manage a Map in Forestry, this class
stores changes as proxies instead of creating multiple copies of the entire map as it changes over time,
reducing the memory footprint of large Map collections over time.

MapCollection is a child class of [`Collection`](/api/collection); all custom functionality
is in class methods, so you are free to implement any custom actions you wish through the third parameter.

## Constructor

you can define a type for the keys and values as generators:

```
const myMapCollection = new MapCollection<string, number>(
  'population',
  {initial: new Map(...)},
  {...actions},
  new Forest()
);
```

You cannot create specific key / value typing pairs - the type constraints are homogenous for all keys and values.

## Methods

### `has(key): boolean`

equivalent of `Map.has`: returns true if the value contains the given key

###  `delete(key)`

removes a single key from the value

### `deleteMany(keys: any[])`

removes multiple keys from the value

### `get(key: any): value | undefined`

returns the value for a key, if it exists; or undefined if it does not.

### `clearData()`

empties the map - replaces it with an empty `Map()`.

### `keys(): <KeyType[]>`

returns an iterator over the keys of the map

### `values(): <ValueType[]>`

returns an iterator over the values of the map
