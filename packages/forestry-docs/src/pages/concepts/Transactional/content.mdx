This means you don't end up with "half changed" state from nested actions,
and you can trap errors at any stage to continue with the previous state.

## Setup Code

This code sets up a system wherein the egg array requires each egg to be 1+ days left
("expiration date"). if an egg is bad the whole carton cannot be submitted.

The actions allow us to "take a day off each egg."

<EggSample />

The `removeADay` action lowers the day of each egg by one

--- with a looping sub-action that changes each egg incrementally.

This means four sub-actions advance the state of individual eggs --
and given `removeEggDay' can throw, this might mean the carton gets "out of sync".

But because of actions' transactional wrapping, the state is wholly reverted on a throw,
which collappsed the `removeADay` changes -- wholesale.

however, `removeADayWithCatch` will interrupt the rollback to only allow a rollback of the
one (or more) bad eggs, and instead, removes that egg and loops forward.

```JavaScript
// ---- intial value
console.log(eggs.value);
/**
[
  { id: 'alpha', daysLeft: 4 },
  { id: 'beta', daysLeft: 3 },
  { id: 'gamma', daysLeft: 2 },
];
*/

// --- less one day for all eggs
eggs.act('removeADay');

console.log(eggs.value);
/**
[
  { id: 'alpha', daysLeft: 3 },
  { id: 'beta', daysLeft: 2 },
  { id: 'gamma', daysLeft: 1 },
]
*/

// --- "bad action" - state is neutralized, and
// kept at origianl value

try {eggs.act('removeADay') } catch (err) {
  console.log('error:',  err.message);
  /**
  'error: Egg has expired';
  */
}
console.log(eggs.value);
/**
[
  { id: 'alpha', daysLeft: 3 },
  { id: 'beta', daysLeft: 2 },
  { id: 'gamma', daysLeft: 1 },
]
*/

// ---- insulated action - sub-process is trapped,
// and "bad egg" is removed from carton

eggs.act('removeADayWithCatch');
console.log(eggs.value);

/**
[
  { id: 'alpha', daysLeft: 2 },
  { id: 'beta', daysLeft: 1 },
]
*/

```

So, if the validator throws and collapses an action,
you are "back to square one". However if you trap a thrown sub-action,
you can continue on with your processes.
