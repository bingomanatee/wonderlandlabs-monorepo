The `addTree<T>(name, params)` method returns a tree
whose value is defined by the generator key. All subscribers will be informed
as to what type of value is managed by the tree.

While the dynamic nature of Collection actions make it impossible to define
the parameters of actions, you can define your own methods by extending Collections
to create custom accessors to your actions and define the interfaces to tree updates.

```JavaScript

const f = new Forest();

const INITIAL: DataType = {...};
const t: treeIF<DataType> = f.addTree<DataType>(
'myTree', {initial: INITIAL},
 {},
  f);

// --- or ---

const coll : CollectionIF<DataType> = new Collection<DataType>('myColl', {initial: INITIAL}, {}, f);

const sub = f.observe<DataType>('myTree', (value: DataType) => {...});

```
