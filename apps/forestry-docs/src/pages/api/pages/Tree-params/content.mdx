The configuration of a Tree has a host of options. At minimum `initial` must be set;
all other arguments are optional. `validator` is recommended.

Other than the validator and the initial value all these parameters optimize large-history
storage; the details aren't necessarily important for transient stores or stores
that are based on simple / static values like numbers or strings. Complex data should have
a `maxBranches` and `trimTo` value if used in production.

## Fields

### initial: `<ValueType>`

The starting value of the state. **REQUIRED**

### validator: `(value) => Error | falsy`

A function that either throws or returns an error if the property is invalid.
Should return falsy for valid values.

```
const treeParams = {
    initial: 0,
    validator(value) {
        if (typeof value !== number) throw new Error('Value must be a number');
        if (value < 0) return new Error('value must be >= 0');
        return false;
      }
}
```

### dontCache: `boolean`

set to true to disable the storing of the output of `update()` methods in cache.
Will re-compute the value every time it is accessed from `.myTree.value`.

### maxBranches: `number`

The maximum number of historical elements to save. it's recommended to be at least 80 items.
Simple/static store values can have a value in the hundreds or thousands.

### trimTo: `number`

if maxBranches is set (and exceeded) the tree is trimmed to the `trimTo` size.
This is a number that is less than maxBranches
but large enough to maintain a reasonable history, at least 50 items.
recommended 60-80% of `maxBranches`.

Note - there are some circumstances, when open transactions are in play, that the actual number
of branches retained will be longer than your desired maxBranches; however ultimately your tree
will be kept at or near to trimTo past items stored (branches)
-- or rather a number between maxBranches and TimTo.

### serializer: `({ $branch: BranchIF<ValueType>; tree: TreeIF<ValueType>; value: Value;  }) => value: ValueType`

reduces the value (which in some cases may be a nested proxy) to a simple value, functionally identical
to the proxy. This is necessary for MapCollection or any custom update function that produces a proxy.
Otherwise, omit this property.

### BenchmarkInterval: `number`

how many changes a tree can undergo before its value is serialized. Important to prevent deep
proxy nesting if proxies are used, or if dontCache is true, nested function calls to update deltas.

## Example

```
const forest = new Forest();
const tree = forest.addTree('generalObject', {
    initial: {},
    dontCache: true,
    serializer: ({value) {
        return {...value};
    },
    benchmarkInterval: 10});

 const addProp = (value, [key, value]) => {
    return {...value, [key]: value}
    }

tree.update(addProp, ['username', 'Bob Smith']);
tree.update(addProp, ['password', '$abc123']);
...
```

because dontCache is set, every time `tree.update(..)` is called, all the updates will be called
in reverse order of assertion; however every ten changes, the nested call will be asserted as if
`tree.next(tree.params.serializer({value: tree.value})` had been called.
