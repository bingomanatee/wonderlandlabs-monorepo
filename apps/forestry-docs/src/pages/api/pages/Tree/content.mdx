## Tree

Trees are single value stores. What exactly that "single value" is is completely open -
Trees can store anything that can be stored in a Javascript reference: Maps, arrays,
strings, numbers, etc.

## Changing a Tree value

While changing a tree with `myTree.next(value)` is easiest (and for scalar values, the best) way
to change state for simple values, for complex values or dense objects, `myTree.update(changeFn, seed?)`
is generally a better way to change _part_ of the state; it takes less memory especially if you reuse
the changeFn out of a library.

## Constructor

Tree takes three arguments:

* `$name`: a string; can be anything of any length (it functions as a "Map" key)
* `params`: defined by TreeParams; at minimum it is `{initial: [value]}`, the value of the state at start.
  See [TreeParams](/api/tree-params) for an exhaustive list of properties.
* `forest`: a [`Forest`](/api/forest) instance.

That being said - trees are instantiated via `myForest.addTree($name, params)`
rather than `new Tree($name, params, forest)`.

```
const f = new Forest();

const counter: TreeIF<number> = f.addTree<number>('counter', {initial: 3});

```

Those familiar with RxJS will recognize much of the profile of BehaviorSubject. Trees don't share code
with BehaviorSubjects but they do have most of the same interface.

## Methods

### `next(value: <ValueType>): void`

Sets the current value of the Tree. If the validator fails, will throw.

### `update((currentValue: <ValueType>, seed?: any) => nextValue)`

changes the value of the collection parametrically.

```
const forest = new Forest();
const increment = (n) => n + 1;
const add(n, seed) => n + seed;
const counter = new Collection('counter', {initial: 0}, {});
const $broadcast = counter.subscribe((value) => console.log('counter = ', value));
// counter = 0
counter.update(increment);
// counter = 1;
counter.update(increment);
// counter = 2;
counter.update(add, 5);
// counter = 7;
```

### `subscribe(onChange):` [`subscription`](https://rxjs.dev/guide/subscription)

adds a listener to the value of the tree. Will $broadcast immediately when added with the
current state value.

### `observe(onChange):` [`subscription`](https://rxjs.dev/guide/subscription)

returns a subscribable that updates every time all pending actions complete.

### `$validate(value: <ValueType>): {$isValid: boolean, error?: string, tree, value}`

returns information about the validity of a value. Does not throw, or change the value of the tree.

## Properties

### `value: <ValueType>`

The current value of the state.
