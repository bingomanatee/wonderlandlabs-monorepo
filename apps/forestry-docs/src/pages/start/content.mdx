import  EggSample   from './../concepts/Transactional/eggSample.mdx';
import  BuyEggsAndHamWithForestry  from './../concepts/Synchronous/BuyEggsAndHamWithForestry.mdx';

install Forestry from npm:

```
npm i @wonderlandlabs/forestry

yarn add @wonderlandlabs/forestry
```

### Dependencies and Compatibility

Forestry depends on:

* [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/guide/overview)
* a few functions from lodash (isEqual, uniqWith)

Forestry does not depend on browser APIs or any specific view library; it can work in Node or the Browser.
It's compatible with React, Angular, Vue and vanilla javascript applications.

### Developing a Store

How you use Forestry depends on the style of use you want in managing your store.

If you just want to have a value available and change it externally you can use a basic
Tree instance as a store. If you want to bundle change methods with your store use a Collection.

### A basic Tree Store

```JavaScript
const forest = new Forest();
const counter = forest.addTree<number>(
  'counter',
  {
    initial: 0,
    validator({value}) {
      if (typeof value !== 'number') throw new Error('counter must be a number');
      if (Number.isNaN(value)) throw new Error('not a number');
    }
  }
);

const sub = counter.subscribe((n) => console.log('counter is now ',n ));
// counter is now 0
counter.next(100);
// counter is now 100
counter.update((n) => n + 10);
// counter is now 110

```

i.e., tree will simply act as a validation enforced stream. Here's a more
involved example with React integration:

<BuyEggsAndHamWithForestry show />


### Full Collection

If you want to bundle your actions with your store, you can use a collection.

<EggSample />
