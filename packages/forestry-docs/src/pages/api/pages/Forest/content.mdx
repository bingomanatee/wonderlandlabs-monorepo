## One or Many Forests?

Every Forest has a unique list of trees indexed by name. Unless there is a chance of name collision,
you can use the same Forest for an entire application or use case.

However, for transient states (local React contexts) it may be better to create a unique local
Forest for the component's state.

## Constructor

Forest's constructor takes no arguments:

```
const f = new Forest();
```

## Methods


###  `addTree<ValueType>(name: string, params: TreeParams): Tree`

Creates a tree with the given value:

```
const forest = new Forest();
forest.addTree<number>(name, { initial: amount });
```

### `do(fn: function, ...args: any[]): any`

calls fn with args, and returns its result. Any thrown errors will roll back all trees
that were changed in the function to their state before the function occurred.

Here is a unit test demonstrating this behavior:

```
it('should accept arguments to do', () => {
  const forest = new Forest();

  const stringer = forest.addTree<string>('string-tree*', {
    initial: '',
    validator: (value) => {
      if (typeof value !== 'string') {
        throw new Error('value must be a string');
      }
    },
  });

  const number = forest.addTree<number>('number-tree*', {
    initial: 0,
  });

  function setValues(num, string) {
    number.next(num);
    stringer.next(string);
  }

  setValues(100, 'a string');

  expect(() => {
    setValues(200, 200);
  }).toThrow('value must be a string');

  expect(number.value).toBe(200);
  // without do, the first tree change persists

  expect(() => {
    forest.do(setValues, 300, 300);
  }).toThrow('value must be a string');
  // with do it's 'all or nothing' - the error resets
  // both states to their previous state.

  expect(number.value).toBe(200);
});
```

### `uniqueTreeName(candidate: string)`

Creates a name variant that is not stored in the forest currently.
Useful when you want to create a a state but name identity is not required.

```
const forest = new Forest();

const makeState = (name, value) => forest.addTree(
  const tree = forest.uniqueTreeName(name), {initial: value});
  console.log('tree', tree.name, 'has value', value);
);

const foo = makeState('foo', 100); // tree foo has value 100
const foo1 = makeState('foo', 200); // tree foo-1 has value 200;
const foo2 = makeState('foo', 400); // tree foo-2 has value 400;
```

### `hasTree(name: string): boolean`

Test to see if the forest contains a Tree with a given name.console

## `<ValueType>tree(name: string) : Tree | undefined`

returns a previously created tree with the given name if it exists.

## Properties

### `time: integer`

the current order number.
